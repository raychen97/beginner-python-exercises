Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number. 
(If you don’t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number. 
For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)


number = int(input('Enter a number '))

a = range(1, number+1)
b = []

for x in a:
    if (number % x == 0):
        b.append(x)
print(b)
